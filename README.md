## IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

# DESCRIPTION:
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using Machine Learning techniques.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple algorithms.

# LIBRARIES USED:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

# ML MODELS USED:
- logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
# DATASET:
The Iris dataset contains measurements such as:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
These features are used to predict the flower species.



# STEPS PERFORMED:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Pairplots & Heatmaps)
- Train–Test Split
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
- Model Training & Prediction
- Accuracy Comparison
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- Feature Importance Visualization

# RESULT:
All models produced high accuracy.
Random Forest showed the best overall performance.
Petal Length and Petal Width were identified as the most influential features for classification.
